### Jeongwoo Yoon
- Coded the following:
  - ALU.v
  - CPU_tb.v
  - Multiplexer
- Block Diagrams
- ISA.png
- Referred to the textbook and the internet for guidance on:
  - How to write code in verilog
  - The structure of the ARMv8 CPU
### Jin Wook Lee
- Coded the following:
  - Data_Memory.v
  - Instruction_Memory.v
  - Registers.v
- ControlBits.png
- Reached out to others (Professor and classmates) for guidance
  - Received help from Justin Koe (also student of ECE251) on initial stages of design process.
  - Discussed plan and received feedback from Alexa Jacobs (ECE251 TA)
### Together
- Coded the following:
  - CPU.v
- Even though we broke down the work done by individual members, all the work was completed together on the same screen. This included discussions on design choices such as data sizes, functions as well as necessary modules.
